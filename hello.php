	Just hold on, we're in this together
	Like a ghost, like a vampire
	Hey spirit, can I take you home?
	Survive, overdrive
	A thousand teeth of a thousand voices
	When the sun goes down, it goes on and on
	(On and on and on and on and-)
	Enter the night through the eye of the storm
	This dark machine, an impossible hero
	Hey starlight, yo battle bird
	Only in dreams can I take you home
	Survive, overdrive
	A thousand teeth of a thousand voices
	When the sun goes down, it goes on and on
	(On and on and on and on and-)
	Hold it, Hell's right here
	My fingers, slip the controls I steer
	As the blood, eyes, hope dies
	A thousand ways to overdrive, go
	Drive, push, harder
	Drive, push, harder
	Hold it, Hell's right here
	My fingers, slip the controls I steer
	As the blood, eyes, hope dies
	A thousand ways to overdrive";
